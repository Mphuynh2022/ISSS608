This website is my portfolio to showcase the different exercises that I have done to practice visualization skills and techniques.

**Hands-on Exercises** are pre-class preparation for our lectures.

**In-Class Exercises** are done during lectures to demonstrate important concepts taught by Prof. Kam Tin Seong.

**Take-home Exercises** are mini projects that allow me to apply the skills I have learnt.
